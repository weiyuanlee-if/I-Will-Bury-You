# I-Will-Bury-You

A narrative web game made with HTML/CSS/Javascript and pixel art. I Will Bury You is based off TTRPGs (Tabletop Text Roleplaying Games). It is essentially a solo rpg since the computer who plays against you is not real, I have not coded multiplayer into this game (maybe that can be a future feature). It was inspired by Takuma Okada's Alone in the Ancient City and Ben Roswell's The Yearning Oracle.

Summary

You play as a hurricane survivor who experiences a near death situation of being buried under a house. You find out your loved one has died and their body hasn't been found. First choose your loved one's pronouns, your relationship (platonic, familial, or romantic) your cards and dice rolls.

Development

This game was made to exemplify basic Javascript skills with the building of randomized dice and a card deck. CSS animation instead of animated art is used on the cubes and cards. There is a save function, game logic for choices and story writing. HTML/CSS is made without a framework and is responsive.
