# I-Will-Bury-You

A narrative web game made with HTML/CSS/Javascript and pixel art made in Phaser 3. I Will Bury You is inspired by TTRPGs (Tabletop Text Roleplaying Games). It is essentially a solo rpg since the computer who plays against you is not real, I have not coded multiplayer into this game (maybe that can be a future feature). It was inspired by Takuma Okada's Alone in the Ancient City and Ben Roswell's The Yearning Oracle.

Summary

You play as a tsunami survivor who experienced a near death situation of being buried under a house. You find out your loved one has died and their body hasn't been found. First choose your loved one's pronouns, your relationship (platonic, familial, or romantic) your cards and roll dice. 
Development

This game was made to exemplify basic Javascript skills with the building of randomized dice and a card deck. There is a save function, game logic for choices and story writing.
